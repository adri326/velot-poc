# velot-poc

This is a proof of concept.
This app allows you to turn your regular keyboard into a velotype keyboard.

Substitutions are put on the right-hand side box, using the following syntax:

```
keys:To be substituted
```

The order of the letters within `keys` do not matter.

`keys` may be:
- a set of lowercase letters (a-z)
- a set of numbers
- a mix of both
- a single, non-alphanumerical character

`To be substituted` can be pretty much anything :)
